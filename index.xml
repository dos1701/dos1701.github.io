With more than 10 years of experience, in these last 5 years I dedicated myself entirely to cloud native solutions.
I’m obsessed with Kubernetes, microservices, event driven architectures, Kafka and NoSQL datastores. I love learning new stuff and share knowledge with others, experimenting whenever possible embracing a fail fast / recover quickly approach.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://thedos.dev/gpg/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://thedos.dev/gpg/</guid><description>Public Keys In this section you can find my public keys, please feel free to use them while getting in contact with me.
